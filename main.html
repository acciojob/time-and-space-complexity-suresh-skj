    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its task, based on the size of the input. It is crucial for determining how efficient an algorithm is, especially when dealing with large datasets. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory or space an algorithm needs to run as a function of the input size. It helps in understanding the storage requirements of an algorithm. For example, an algorithm with space complexity O(n) means the required space grows linearly with the input size.
